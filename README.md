# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using the UCI Machine Learning Repository's wine quality dataset to better understand:
1. Is red wine or white wine better in quality?
2. What are differences in properties between white wine and red wine?
3. Can we predict if it's white wine or red wine based on its properties?

# File Description
The winequality_red.csv and winequality_white.csv are from UCI Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality), and the data is sourced by:
Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal, http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez
A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis, Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region(CVRVV), Porto, Portugal
@2009
Description of data can also be found in the Repository website.

The Wine_Project_draft1.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for the analyses done pertaining to the questions above. Markdowns were used for easy following of the analyses.

# Results
The main findings of the analyses can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@chao_macau/understanding-your-favorite-wines-a63a6c240bf6).
